- **BDSY – Causal Machine Learning Analysis of Right Heart Catheterization Survival**  
  *R, Python, DeepSurv, RSF, CSF*  
  Developed a survival analysis framework integrating DeepSurv, Random Survival Forests, and Causal Survival Forests to estimate 30–180 day survival and model heterogeneous treatment effects in the SUPPORT dataset.  

- **UT Farm Stand – Market Analytics Dashboard**  
  *R, Shiny, dplyr, ggplot2, Excel, ETL*  
  Engineered an interactive, actively used Shiny app with an automated ETL pipeline to monitor KPIs (sales, attendance, volunteer engagement, and social reach), featuring dynamic filters, multi-dataset selection, and real-time trend visualization.  

- **ASA DataFest at SMU – Digital Textbook Cheating Detection and Engagement Analysis**  
  *R, randomForest, tidyverse*  
  Designed a Random Forest anomaly detection model by integrating six datasets (~246k logs), engineering 20+ features, and flagging 5.6% of students for potential cheating while uncovering other content issues and engagement drop-off trends.  

- **CS 329E – Texas Predictive Health (SDOH) Dashboard**  
  *Python, Dash, Pandas, GeoJSON, scikit-learn, randomForest*  
  Built an interactive county-level dashboard of 2010/2015/2020 Texas SDOH and Adult Health Score data, integrating FIPS, merged datasets, dynamic choropleths, linked scatter/heatmap analytics, and a RandomForest regression for score prediction.
